This is my own path to JavaScript mastery. Once I decided to excell in the language, so I went back to the basics (that details that you usually ignore when you are in the hurry to learn something new) and re-learn from there. This is the path I followed:

1- **Eloquent Javascript:** Eloquent JavaScript is one of the best books on JS as it takes you back to the basics of the languaje.
2- **React TicTacToe game:** Basic React game, from the https://reactjs.org tutorial.
Continous - **Other:** Small scripts to test concepts.
